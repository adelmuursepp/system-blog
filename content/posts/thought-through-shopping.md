So I tried to buy everything as much as possible online, but still, there are some products like jeans, vegan protein or other that I need to get in person. However, here is how I manage to go to the store only once a week.

#### CLOTHES

**H&M online**

* Socks, underwear

**Asos online**

* Sporty shirts
* Jewellery
* Sweater

**Zara**

* Jeans ( I need to see that they fit well so this is definitely in person)

#### FOOD, HYGIENE AND HOME PRODUCTS

Going to the first grocery store that has some necessary things not available on the online store.
