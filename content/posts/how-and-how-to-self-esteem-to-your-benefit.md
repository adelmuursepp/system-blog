title: How (and how) to self esteem to your benefit
author: Adel Müürsepp

Naturally, I myself lack any self-esteem at all. I don't consider myself a good nor a bad person, or somehow different by any other quality. Might be because I don't care about others' opinions or something else, but whatever the reason it has given me a chance to observe how self-esteem impacts other people's lives and mine as well (if I have chosen to create it for myself).

So here are some benefits I have found that apply to my life if I have chosen to simulate other people's self-esteem:

**Moderate low self-esteem:**

* Great attention to other people's feelings, very delicate in social interaction. When being moderately insecure I look for validation in other people and find it easier to appear polite, considerate, and never appear rough by accident.

**Moderate high self-esteem:**

* Very easy to small talk to people. For me, personally, that is a problem as I indicate to others that I am interested in socializing with them, but after a short period of time find them boring or have other priorities like work and studying. As I then lack the consideration for others, I appear rough and rude often.
