title: How to study university Maths yourself?
author: Adel Müürsepp

The biggest obstacle to studying Maths yourself is that you lack a good plan for it. All the topics are interesting but come up randomly and too often you end up covering the same material multiple times. Additionally, this means you lack some foundation to understand each part of the derivations or don't know the notation. This blog post was written to share some of the best materials I have found in the course of trial and error.

### High school Maths/Precalculus/Calculus

High school precalculus: Just take Math 30 textbook (Canadian version) and start going through topics, solving all the problems. The nice thing about the textbooks is that there are solutions at the back to check yourself.

Any time you take too long to understand a topic just watch a Khan Academy video on it.

To polish your integration and calculus skills through problem-solving: [Good calculus problems](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/)

### Discrete Maths

College Discrete Maths course by TrevTutor: [TrevTutor Discrete Maths 1](https://trevtutor.com/discretemath/discretemath1/)

One of a few interesting MOOC courses: [Mathematical thinking in Computer Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-a-proof)

At the same time, it is nice to tackle problems on [Brilliant](brilliant.org). You can choose the courses that are on the same topic and it teaches you to see those concepts from a different viewpoint.
