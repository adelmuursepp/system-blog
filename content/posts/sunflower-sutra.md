I personally think the fact that women have to spend so much time caring for appearance, compared to men, is awfully unfair. This waste of time is also of concern to quite a few feminists who protest against such unfair expectations. However, I have developed a different view on this topic. 

We all know appearance plays a role in advancing a woman's career - [https://www.forbes.com/2009/12/05/appearance-work-pay-forbes-woman-leadership-body-weight.html#79696d0d54d2](https://www.forbes.com/2009/12/05/appearance-work-pay-forbes-woman-leadership-body-weight.html#79696d0d54d2 "Forbes article"). And I certainly am not willing to earn 9% less just because I look unhealthy or don't take care of my hygiene. There is nothing I can change about the stereotypes the employers and my colleagues have, the only way I can be truly empowered is unfortunately by also taking care of my physical look. Keeping in mind I want to make it as efficient as possible so I can mostly focus on my skills, how do I do it?

### What really **is** good appearance?

There are quite a few ways of looking good, so here's my opinion after researching this topic.

**Good:**

Healthy – Keeping a healthy weight, good dental hygiene, healthy hair and more signals you are on top of things and your life is in order. 

Youthful  – Surprisingly, this played quite a big role in women's salary (Cornell University study).

Professional – Conforming to the business etiquette makes a person look reliable.

Paying attention to details – No holes or stains or old shoes, understandably...

**Bad**

Too provocative – Although it doesn't matter on workplaces with lower wages, climbing the ladder, it proves to be a real hinder. Good look without professional style will make one look incompetent.

Neon colours – Why would anyone wear childish colours or elaborate patterns?

Cheap clothes or jewellery – Better size down your wardrobe than opt for street fashion.

Overaccessorised – Better to have some effective items than to showcase all you got.

So if I oversimplify – **look healthy, reliable and as if every item is very well thought through.** 

### How will I look healthy?

As habits are such a big part of health, here I can make great use of any system. 

Here are the habits I marked down with desired frequencies:

1. Some workout 5 times a week
2. Three healthy meals a day
3. 9 hours of sleep
4. Wash hair and get a cut if needed, 2 times a week
5. All the other obvious hygiene procedures like showering, shaving and brushing teets, ...

### Next, how do I always look put together?

Simply, how can I ensure that it is impossible to notice any problem in my appearance like clothes that don't fit, ugly nail polish or so on? What if instead of creating this self-consuming paranoic thinking, I could create a system with checkpoints to ensure that over some period each important part is checked.

So I thought, well, what things always need to be in order and what would be the frequency for them? I'm not including here how to shop for quality clothes or have good makeup (the internet is full of beauty bloggers).

So I ordered gel nails equipment because I know that it lasts for a week and created a schedule based on these notes.
