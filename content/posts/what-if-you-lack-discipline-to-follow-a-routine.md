title: What if you lack motivation to follow a routine?
author: Adel Müürsepp

#### Too tired

This is the worst. If you are tired you automatically have less control over your time, for example you won't be able to work in the afternoon or go to work out in the evening because your eyes are closing involuntarily. This destroys your whole planned routine.

This is why you should be extra careful to sleep every day for 9 hours. No matter what others do or what you believe, you **do** need 9 hours to sleep for your five sleep cycles. It is for your health, brain and discipline, just go to bed early!

#### In need for spontaneity

Some people claim they can't stand routine in their lives. I used to be such a person for pretty much my whole life. However, this means two things for these people:

* **They actually already have a routine, it is just horrible and unsustainable**
* **They are constantly planning and thinking about things they need to do**
* **It is very much harder for them to keep a healthy lifestyle**

#### Routine keeps you under constant stress

Go work out. It helps make you human and while you're working out it is also impossible to keep thinking about work. Rest your body and mind, get this adrenaline in your blood.

#### Think about your dreams and goals during the hard times

This is what I think about, in order:

1. Alright, I am suffering right now and am stressing out. Although as I have seen in my experience this only makes me more resilient and teaches me work ethic.
2. Okay, I am suffering right now and I can't even care about my future self. I am so tired and so stressed I only want to lie in my bed.
   1. Remember your primary dream. If you don't have one right now, you should write it as fast as possible.
      1. For example, if you would want to have some profession, write it down.
      2. Who would you make happy with the money you could earn?
      3. Could you make the world a better place then? Maybe you could be a volunteer teacher in Africa, ...
      4. Would anyone feel proud of you and how would it make you feel?
   2. If you still have no motivation to work for your dream, remember your next dream. If you also don't have this, write it down as fast as possible.
      1. What profession or accomplishment is so cool that is related to your work? Or you can just list out all the cool things that your work would allow you to accomplish.
      2. How could you make other people happy through it?
      3. Could you make the world a better place then?
      4. Would someone feel proud of you?

#### Do cheat days

If you see absolutely no point in continuing with your routine or work, for a day just don't. Take out IMDB top 250 movies list or Money Heist and just binge on it. Action movies really make me at least motivated and give me the inspiration to do some work.

If possible, arrange a trip to some other location with family or friends. Go to the cinema, go surfing, take up a new hobby like choir or tennis or chess, read a book. Just do what you want to do.
