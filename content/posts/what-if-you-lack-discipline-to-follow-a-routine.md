title: What if you lack motivation to follow a routine?
author: Adel Müürsepp

#### Too tired

This is the worst. If you are tired you automatically have less control over your time, for example you won't be able to work in the afternoon or go to work out in the evening because your eyes are closing involuntarily. This destroys your whole planned routine.

This is why you should be extra careful to sleep every day for 9 hours. No matter what others do or what you believe, you **do** need 9 hours to sleep for your five sleep cycles. It is for your health, brain and discipline, just go to bed early!

#### In need for spontaneity

Some people claim they can't stand routine in their lives. I used to be such a person for pretty much my whole life. However, this means two things for these people:

* **They actually already have a routine, it is just horrible and unsustainable**

* **They are constantly planning and thinking about things they need to do**

* **It is very much harder for them to keep a healthy lifestyle**
